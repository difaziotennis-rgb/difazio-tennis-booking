# How to Find and Access Your Domain Registrar

## Quick Method: Check WHOIS

I've run a check to find your registrar. Here are common ways to find it:

## Step 1: Check Your Email

Look in your email for:
- Domain purchase confirmation
- Domain renewal notices
- Bills from domain registrars

Common registrars:
- **GoDaddy** - godaddy.com
- **Namecheap** - namecheap.com
- **Google Domains** - domains.google.com
- **Cloudflare** - cloudflare.com
- **Name.com** - name.com
- **Network Solutions** - networksolutions.com
- **Hover** - hover.com

## Step 2: Check WHOIS Information

Run this command to see who manages your domain:
```bash
whois difaziotennis.com | grep -i "registrar"
```

Or visit: https://whois.net and search for `difaziotennis.com`

## Step 3: Common Registrar Login Pages

### GoDaddy
- Login: https://sso.godaddy.com
- DNS: Go to "My Products" → "DNS" → "Manage DNS"

### Namecheap
- Login: https://www.namecheap.com/myaccount/login/
- DNS: Domain List → Manage → Advanced DNS

### Google Domains
- Login: https://domains.google.com
- DNS: Click your domain → DNS

### Cloudflare
- Login: https://dash.cloudflare.com
- DNS: Select domain → DNS → Records

### Name.com
- Login: https://www.name.com/account/login
- DNS: Domain List → Manage → DNS Records

## Step 4: What You Need to Do

Once you're in your registrar's DNS settings:

1. **Find DNS Management** (usually called "DNS", "DNS Records", "Name Servers", or "Zone File")

2. **Add the records Vercel gives you** (usually these types):
   - **A Record**: Points to an IP address
   - **CNAME Record**: Points to another domain (like `cname.vercel-dns.com`)

3. **Vercel will show you something like:**
   ```
   Type: A
   Name: @
   Value: 76.76.21.21
   
   Type: CNAME
   Name: www
   Value: cname.vercel-dns.com
   ```

4. **Add those records** in your registrar's DNS panel

5. **Save and wait** 5-60 minutes for DNS to propagate
