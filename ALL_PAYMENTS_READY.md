## If Stripe Still Shows Error

If you see "Stripe is not configured" after adding keys:

1. **Redeploy**: After adding keys, Vercel needs to redeploy
   - Go to Vercel Dashboard → Your Project → Deployments
   - Click "Redeploy" on latest deployment
   - Or push a new commit to trigger auto-deploy

2. **Check Environment**: Make sure keys are checked for:
   - ✅ Production
   - ✅ Preview
   - ✅ Development

3. **Verify Keys**: In Vercel Dashboard → Settings → Environment Variables:
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` should start with `pk_`
   - `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` should start with `sk_`

4. **Hard Refresh**: Clear browser cache
   - Chrome/Edge: `Ctrl+Shift+R` (Windows) or `Cmd+Shift+R` (Mac)
