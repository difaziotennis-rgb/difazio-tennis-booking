# Cron Job Fix - Hobby Plan Limitation

## The Problem

Your Vercel deployment was failing because:
- ❌ You're on the **Hobby plan**
- ❌ Hobby plan only allows cron jobs to run **once per day**
- ❌ Your cron was configured to run **every 5 minutes** (`*/5 * * * *`)
- ❌ Vercel rejected this configuration

## What I Fixed

I **removed the cron job** from `vercel.json` so your deployments will work.

## Options for Court Availability Syncing

### Option 1: Manual Sync (Free)
You can manually trigger the sync by visiting:
- `https://difaziotennis.com/api/cron/sync-courts`

Or I can add a button in the admin panel to trigger it manually.

### Option 2: Upgrade to Pro Plan ($20/month)
- Allows unlimited cron invocations
- Can run every 5 minutes
- More reliable timing

### Option 3: External Cron Service (Free/Paid)
Use an external service like:
- **cron-job.org** (free)
- **EasyCron** (free tier available)
- **UptimeRobot** (free tier available)

These services will ping your endpoint every 5 minutes.

### Option 4: Run Once Per Day (Free)
I can change the cron to run once per day (Hobby plan limit):
- Schedule: `0 1 * * *` (1 AM daily)
- But Vercel says timing isn't guaranteed on Hobby plan

## Recommendation

**For now**: The cron job is removed. Court availability syncing will work when:
- Users check availability (it checks in real-time)
- You manually trigger the sync endpoint

**If you want automatic syncing**: Upgrade to Pro plan or use an external cron service.

## Manual Sync Endpoint

You can manually sync by visiting:
```
https://difaziotennis.com/api/cron/sync-courts
```

Or I can add an admin button to trigger it from your admin panel.

## Next Steps

1. ✅ **Deployment should work now** - try deploying again
2. **Choose**: Manual sync, upgrade to Pro, or use external cron service
3. **Let me know** if you want me to add a manual sync button in admin panel
