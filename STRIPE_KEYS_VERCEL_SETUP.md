# How to Set Up Stripe Keys in Vercel - Step by Step

## Step 1: Get Your Stripe Keys

1. **Go to**: https://dashboard.stripe.com
2. **Login** to your Stripe account
3. **Click**: "Developers" (top right menu)
4. **Click**: "API keys" (left sidebar)
5. **You'll see two keys**:
   - **Publishable key** (starts with `pk_test_` for testing or `pk_live_` for production)
   - **Secret key** (starts with `sk_test_` for testing or `sk_live_` for production)
   - Click "Reveal test key" or "Reveal live key" to see the secret key

**Copy both keys** - you'll need them in the next step.

## Step 2: Go to Vercel Dashboard

1. **Go to**: https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. **Login** to your Vercel account
3. **Click** on your project: `difazio-tennis-booking` (or whatever it's named)

---

## Step 3: Navigate to Environment Variables

1. **Click**: "Settings" (left sidebar, under your project name)
2. **Click**: "Environment Variables" (under "Configuration" section)

---

## Step 4: Add/Update Stripe Keys

### Add First Key: NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY

1. **Click**: "Add New" button (top right)
2. **Key**: Type exactly: `NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`
   - ⚠️ **Important**: Copy this exactly, including underscores and capitalization
3. **Value**: Paste your Stripe publishable key (starts with `pk_test_` or `pk_live_`)
4. **Environments**: Check ALL THREE boxes:
   - ✅ Production
   - ✅ Preview
   - ✅ Development
5. **Click**: "Save"

### Add Second Key: STRIPE_SECRET_KEY

1. **Click**: "Add New" button again
2. **Key**: Type exactly: `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`
   - ⚠️ **Important**: Copy this exactly, no `NEXT_PUBLIC_` prefix for the secret key
3. **Value**: Paste your Stripe secret key (starts with `sk_test_` or `sk_live_`)
4. **Environments**: Check ALL THREE boxes:
   - ✅ Production
   - ✅ Preview
   - ✅ Development
5. **Click**: "Save"

---

## Step 5: Verify Keys Are Added

You should now see TWO environment variables in the list:

1. ✅ `NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` = `pk_test_...` or `pk_live_...`
2. ✅ `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` = `sk_test_...` or `sk_live_...`

Both should have all three environments checked (Production, Preview, Development).

---

## Step 6: Update Existing Keys (If They Already Exist)

If the keys already exist but aren't working:

1. **Find** the key in the list
2. **Click** on it (or click the "..." menu → "Edit")
3. **Update** the Value field with the correct key
4. **Verify** all three environments are checked:
   - ✅ Production
   - ✅ Preview
   - ✅ Development
5. **Click**: "Save"

**OR** to completely reset:

1. **Click** the "..." menu next to the key
2. **Click**: "Delete"
3. **Add it again** using Step 4 above

---

## Step 7: Force Redeploy (CRITICAL!)

After adding/updating keys, you MUST redeploy:

1. **Go to**: "Deployments" tab (top menu)
2. **Find** the latest deployment
3. **Click**: "..." (three dots) on the right
4. **Click**: "Redeploy"
5. **IMPORTANT**: When you see "Use existing Build Cache"
   - **UNCHECK** this box ❌
   - This forces Vercel to rebuild with the new keys
6. **Click**: "Redeploy"
7. **Wait**: 3-5 minutes for the deployment to complete

---

## Step 8: Verify It's Working

1. **Wait** for deployment to finish (check the status in Deployments tab)
2. **Open** an Incognito/Private window (to avoid cache)
3. **Go to**: https://difaziotennis.com/book
4. **Select** a time slot → Fill form → Continue to Payment
5. **Click**: "Pay with Card" (Stripe button)
6. **Should**: Redirect to Stripe Checkout (not show an error)

---

## Troubleshooting

### Still seeing "Stripe is not configured"?

1. ✅ **Check key names are EXACT**:
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` (with `NEXT_PUBLIC_` prefix)
   - `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` (NO `NEXT_PUBLIC_` prefix)

2. ✅ **Check all environments are checked**:
   - Production ✅
   - Preview ✅
   - Development ✅

3. ✅ **Redeploy without cache**:
   - Go to Deployments → Redeploy → Uncheck "Use existing Build Cache"

4. ✅ **Check keys start with correct prefix**:
   - Publishable: `pk_test_` or `pk_live_`
   - Secret: `sk_test_` or `sk_live_`

5. ✅ **Test in Incognito mode** (bypasses browser cache)

### Keys are correct but still not working?

1. **Check Vercel deployment logs**:
   - Go to Deployments → Click on latest deployment
   - Check "Build Logs" for any errors

2. **Verify keys in Stripe dashboard**:
   - Make sure you're using the correct keys (test vs live)
   - Make sure keys haven't been revoked

3. **Try deleting and re-adding**:
   - Delete both keys
   - Add them again from scratch
   - Redeploy without cache
