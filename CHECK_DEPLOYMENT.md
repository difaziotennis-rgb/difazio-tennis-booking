- Look at the **"Deployments"** tab
- You should see a deployment with status:
  - ✅ **"Ready"** or **"Building"** = Good!
  - ❌ **"Error"** or **"Failed"** = Need to fix

### 2. Check the Deployment
- Click on the latest deployment
- Look at the **"Build Logs"** or **"Logs"** tab
- Should see: "Build Completed" or "Deployment Ready"

### 3. Visit Your Site
Your site should be live at:
- **https://difazio-tennis-booking.vercel.app**
- Or check the deployment for the URL
