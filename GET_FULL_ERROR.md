# How to Get the Full Vercel Error

## The logs you shared only show the beginning

The error message comes **AFTER** "Creating an optimized production build..."

## Steps to Get Full Error:

1. **Go to**: https://vercel.com/dashboard → Your Project
2. **Click** the red/failed deployment
3. **Scroll down** in the build logs
4. **Look for**:
   - Lines that say "Error:"
   - Lines that say "Failed"
   - Red text
   - Lines that say "✗" or "×"
5. **Copy** everything from "Error:" or "Failed" onwards

## What to Look For:

The error will likely say something like:
- `Error: ...`
- `Failed to compile`
- `Type error: ...`
- `Module not found: ...`
- `Build failed`

## Quick Check:

In the Vercel build logs, scroll down past:
- "Creating an optimized production build..."
- "Compiled successfully" (if it gets that far)
- Any warnings

**The error will be in red text** and will say what went wrong.

## Common Locations:

- Right after "Creating an optimized production build..."
- After "Linting and checking validity of types..."
- After "Compiling..."
- At the very end of the logs
