# Finding Vercel Settings

## Where to Look:

### Option 1: Project Settings
1. Click on your **project name** (not deployment)
2. Click **"Settings"** tab at the top
3. Look for:
   - **"General"** section
   - **"Build & Development Settings"** section
   - **"Build Command"** field

### Option 2: Deployment Settings
1. Click on a **deployment** (the failed one)
2. Look for **"Settings"** or **"Configure"** button
3. Or click the **"..."** menu (three dots)

### Option 3: Re-import (Easiest!)
Since Vercel should auto-detect Next.js, let's just re-import:

1. **Delete the current project**:
   - Go to project → Settings → General
   - Scroll to bottom → "Delete Project"

2. **Re-import**:
   - Click "Add New Project"
   - Import your GitHub repo again
   - Vercel should auto-detect Next.js this time

## What You Should See:

In Settings, you should see fields like:
- **Framework Preset** (might be auto-detected)
- **Build Command**
- **Output Directory**
- **Install Command**

If you don't see these, try:
- Looking in "Build & Development Settings"
- Or just delete and re-import the project

Let me know what sections you DO see in Settings!
