# Your Domain is with Wix.com - Setup Instructions

## ✅ Found: Your domain registrar is **Wix.com**

## How to Access Your Domain Settings

### Step 1: Login to Wix
1. Go to: **https://www.wix.com/my-account/site-selector**

### Step 3: Update DNS for Vercel

**Option A: Point to Vercel (Recommended)**
1. In Wix domain settings, find **"DNS Records"** or **"Name Servers"**
2. You'll need to either:
   - **Change Name Servers** to Vercel's (Vercel will provide these)
   - OR **Add DNS Records** (A records and CNAME records that Vercel provides)

**Option B: If Wix doesn't allow DNS changes**
- You may need to **transfer the domain** to another registrar
- Or contact Wix support to unlock DNS management

## Important Notes About Wix

⚠️ **Wix sometimes locks DNS management** if you're using their website builder. You may need to:

1. **Check if DNS is locked**: Look for "DNS Management" or "Advanced DNS" in Wix
2. **If locked**: You might need to:
   - Disconnect the domain from a Wix site
   - Or transfer the domain to another registrar (GoDaddy, Namecheap, etc.)

## Alternative: Transfer Domain (If Wix Won't Let You Change DNS)

If Wix won't let you change DNS records, you can transfer to:
- **Namecheap** (easy DNS management)
- **Cloudflare** (free, excellent DNS)
- **GoDaddy** (common, easy to use)

Transfer process:
1. Unlock domain in Wix
2. Get authorization code from Wix
3. Initiate transfer at new registrar
4. Takes 5-7 days

## Quick Steps Summary

1. **Login to Wix**: https://www.wix.com/my-account
2. **Go to Domains** section
3. **Click on difaziotennis.com**
4. **Look for "DNS" or "Name Servers"**
