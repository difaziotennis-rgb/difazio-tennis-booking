# Force Vercel to Rebuild - Step by Step

## The Problem

Vercel is still seeing old code with `await fetch` even though the file is correct. This is a **build cache issue**.

## Solution: Force Complete Rebuild

### Step 1: Clear Vercel Build Cache

1. **Go to**: https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. **Select**: Your project (difazio-tennis-booking)
3. **Go to**: Settings → General
4. **Scroll down** to find any "Clear Cache" or "Build Cache" options
5. **If available**: Click to clear

### Step 2: Delete and Recreate Deployment

**Option A: Cancel and Redeploy**
1. **Go to**: Deployments tab
2. **Find** the failed/red deployment
3. **Click**: "..." → "Cancel" (if building)
4. **Click**: "..." → "Redeploy"
5. **UNCHECK**: "Use existing Build Cache" ❌
6. **Click**: "Redeploy"

**Option B: Create New Deployment**
1. **Go to**: Deployments tab
2. **Click**: "Redeploy" on a **working** deployment (if any)
3. **UNCHECK**: "Use existing Build Cache" ❌
4. **Click**: "Redeploy"

### Step 3: Verify GitHub Has Latest Code

1. **Go to**: https://github.com/difaziotennis-rgb/difazio-tennis-booking
2. **Check** the latest commit shows: "Clean up booking modal - ensure no await in fetch"
3. **If not**: Wait a minute and refresh

### Step 4: Wait for Build

1. **Wait**: 5-7 minutes for complete rebuild
2. **Check**: Build logs to see it's using latest code
3. **Verify**: No errors about `await`

## Alternative: Check Vercel Project Settings

1. **Go to**: Settings → General
2. **Check**: "Build Command" should be: `npm run build`
3. **Check**: "Output Directory" should be: `.next` (or leave default)
4. **Check**: "Install Command" should be: `npm install`

## If Still Failing

The code is 100% correct. If Vercel still shows the error:

1. **Check** if Vercel is connected to the right GitHub branch
2. **Verify** the latest commit is pushed to GitHub
3. **Try** disconnecting and reconnecting the GitHub repo
4. **Contact** Vercel support if the issue persists

## Verification

After rebuild, the build logs should show:
- ✅ No errors about `await`
- ✅ Build completes successfully
- ✅ Deployment shows "Ready" (green)
