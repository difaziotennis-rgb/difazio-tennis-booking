# Fix Vercel Configuration

I've updated the `vercel.json` file and pushed it to GitHub. Now you need to update settings in Vercel dashboard:

## Steps in Vercel Dashboard:

1. **Go to your project** (should be open in Chrome)
2. **Click "Settings"** (top menu)
3. **Click "General"** (left sidebar)
4. **Scroll to "Framework Preset"**
   - Select: **"Next.js"**
5. **Scroll to "Build and Output Settings"**
   - **Build Command**: `npm run build` (should auto-fill)
   - **Output Directory**: **LEAVE EMPTY** (don't put anything here!)
   - **Install Command**: `npm install` (should auto-fill)
6. **Click "Save"** at the bottom

## Then Redeploy:

1. Go to **"Deployments"** tab
2. Find the failed deployment
3. Click the **"..."** menu (three dots)
4. Click **"Redeploy"**
5. Wait 2-3 minutes

## Alternative: Delete and Re-import

If that doesn't work:
1. Delete the current project in Vercel
2. Go to "Add New Project"
3. Import your GitHub repo again
4. Vercel should auto-detect Next.js correctly this time

The updated `vercel.json` I pushed should help, but you may still need to set Framework Preset to "Next.js" in the dashboard.
