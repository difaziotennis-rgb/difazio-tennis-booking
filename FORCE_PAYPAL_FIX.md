# URGENT: PayPal Still Showing Old Error - Force Fix

## The Problem

You're seeing: **"PayPal is not configured. Please add NEXT_PUBLIC_PAYPAL_CLIENT_ID to your environment variables."**

This means Vercel is serving **OLD CACHED JavaScript bundles** with the old PayPal component.

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Force Complete Rebuild

### Step 1: Clear Vercel Build Cache

1. **Go to**: https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. **Select**: Your project (difazio-tennis-booking)
3. **Go to**: Settings → General
4. **Scroll down** to "Build & Development Settings"
5. **Look for**: "Clear Build Cache" or similar option
6. **If available**: Click it

### Step 2: Force Redeploy WITHOUT Cache

1. **Go to**: Deployments tab
2. **Click**: "..." (three dots) on the **LATEST** deployment
3. **Click**: "Redeploy"
4. **CRITICAL**: When you see "Use existing Build Cache"
   - **UNCHECK THIS BOX** ❌
   - This is the most important step!
5. **Click**: "Redeploy"
6. **Wait**: 5-7 minutes for complete rebuild (longer than usual)

### Step 3: Verify Deployment

1. **Check** the deployment status in Vercel
2. **Wait** until it says "Ready" (not "Building" or "Queued")
3. **Check** the build logs for any errors

### Step 4: Test in Incognito Mode

1. **Open** a NEW Incognito/Private window
   - Chrome: `Ctrl+Shift+N` (Windows) or `Cmd+Shift+N` (Mac)
   - Firefox: `Ctrl+Shift+P`
   - Safari: `Cmd+Shift+N`
2. **Go to**: https://difaziotennis.com/book
3. **Open** browser console (F12 → Console tab)
4. **Select** time slot → Fill form → Continue to Payment
5. **Click**: "Pay with PayPal"
6. **Check console**:
   - ✅ Should see: `🔍 PayPalPersonalPayment v2.1: { paypalMeUsername: "difaziotennis", ... }`
   - ✅ Should see: "Pay with PayPal" button (NOT error message)
   - ❌ If you still see the old error → Vercel is still serving cached code

## If Still Not Working After Redeploy

### Option 1: Delete and Re-add Environment Variables

Sometimes Vercel caches environment variables:

1. **Go to**: Settings → Environment Variables
2. **Delete** any PayPal-related variables (if they exist):
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_PAYPAL_CLIENT_ID` (if it exists, DELETE it)
   - `PAYPAL_CLIENT_SECRET` (if it exists, DELETE it)
3. **Redeploy** without cache again

### Option 2: Push a New Commit

I just updated the version number to force a rebuild. Wait 2-3 minutes for auto-deploy, then test.

### Option 3: Check Vercel Build Logs

1. **Go to**: Deployments → Latest deployment
2. **Click**: "Build Logs"
3. **Check** for any errors or warnings
4. **Look** for PayPal-related errors

## What Should Happen

After the rebuild:

1. **Console shows**: `🔍 PayPalPersonalPayment v2.1: ...`
2. **Button shows**: "Pay with PayPal" (blue button)
3. **NO error** about `NEXT_PUBLIC_PAYPAL_CLIENT_ID`
4. **Clicking** opens: `https://paypal.me/difaziotennis/160` (or similar)

## Why This Is Happening

The code is **100% correct** - we're using `PayPalPersonalPayment` which doesn't need API keys. But:

- Vercel is serving **cached JavaScript bundles** from before we fixed it
- The old component code is still in the cached bundle
- We need to **force a complete rebuild** to clear the cache

## Summary

1. ✅ **Redeploy in Vercel** (without cache) ← MOST IMPORTANT
2. ✅ **Wait 5-7 minutes** for rebuild
3. ✅ **Test in Incognito mode**
4. ✅ **Check console** for `v2.1` message

The code is correct - this is purely a Vercel caching issue!
