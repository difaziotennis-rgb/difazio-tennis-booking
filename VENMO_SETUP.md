## Step-by-Step Setup

### Step 1: Create PayPal Business Account (15 minutes)

1. **Go to**: https://www.paypal.com/business
2. **Click**: "Sign Up" or "Get Started"
3. **Choose**: Business account
4. **Fill out**:
   - Business name: "DiFazio Tennis" (or your name)
   - Business type: **Individual/Sole Proprietor** (if you're a solo instructor)
   - Email: difaziotennis@gmail.com
   - Phone: 631-901-5220
5. **Verify** your email and phone
6. **Add bank account** (optional but recommended for faster payouts)

**Note**: PayPal Business accounts are **FREE** - no monthly fees!

### Step 2: Get PayPal API Credentials (10 minutes)

1. **Login** to your PayPal Business account
2. **Go to**: https://developer.paypal.com/dashboard

   - **Secret** (click "Show" to reveal it)

### Step 3: Enable Venmo in Your App (Automatic!)

**Good news**: Venmo is already enabled in your code! 

The code includes:
```javascript
"enable-funding": "venmo"
```

This means Venmo will automatically appear as an option when users pay.

### Step 4: Add Credentials to Vercel (5 minutes)

1. **Go to**: https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. **Click** your project: `difazio-tennis-booking`
3. **Go to**: Settings → Environment Variables

   PAYPAL_CLIENT_SECRET = [Your Secret from Step 2]
   ```

5. **Select environment**: Production (and Preview if you want)
6. **Click**: "Save"
7. **Redeploy**: Go to Deployments → Click "..." → "Redeploy"
