# Fix Mobile Site Showing Old Version

## Why This Happens

Mobile browsers cache websites aggressively to save data. Your phone is showing a cached (old) version of your site.

## Quick Fixes (Try These!)

### Option 1: Hard Refresh on Mobile (Easiest)

**iPhone (Safari):**
1. Open Safari
2. Go to difaziotennis.com
3. Tap the address bar
4. Tap and hold the refresh button (circular arrow)
5. Select "Reload Without Content Blockers" or just refresh

**Android (Chrome):**
1. Open Chrome
2. Go to difaziotennis.com
3. Tap the menu (3 dots)
4. Tap "Settings" → "Privacy" → "Clear browsing data"
5. Select "Cached images and files"
6. Tap "Clear data"
7. Refresh the page

### Option 2: Clear Browser Cache

**iPhone:**
1. Settings → Safari
2. Clear History and Website Data
3. Confirm
4. Reload site

**Android:**
1. Chrome → Settings
2. Privacy → Clear browsing data
3. Select "Cached images and files"
4. Clear data
5. Reload site

### Option 3: Use Incognito/Private Mode

1. Open browser in **Private/Incognito mode**
2. Visit difaziotennis.com
3. You'll see the latest version (no cache)

### Option 4: Force Vercel to Clear Cache

I can trigger a new deployment which will clear Vercel's cache. Let me know if you want me to do this.

## Check If Site Is Updated

Visit in a **private/incognito window** - if it shows the new version there, it's definitely a cache issue.

## Still Not Working?

1. **Check deployment status**: Go to https://vercel.com/dashboard and see if latest deployment is "Ready"
2. **Wait a few minutes**: Sometimes takes 5-10 minutes for all CDN nodes to update
3. **Try different network**: Switch from WiFi to mobile data (or vice versa)

Let me know what you see and I can help further!
