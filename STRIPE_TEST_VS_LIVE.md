# Stripe Test Keys vs Live Keys - Explained

## Your Keys Are Correct!

If your `NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` starts with `pk_test_`, that's **CORRECT** for testing!

## Stripe Key Types

### Test Keys (for development/testing)
- **Publishable Key**: Starts with `pk_test_`
- **Secret Key**: Starts with `sk_test_`
- **Use**: Testing payments without charging real cards
- **Test Cards**: Use `4242 4242 4242 4242` to test

### Live Keys (for real payments)
- **Publishable Key**: Starts with `pk_live_`
- **Secret Key**: Starts with `sk_live_`
- **Use**: Accepting real payments from customers
- **Real Cards**: Customers use their actual credit cards

## Which Should You Use?

### Use Test Keys (`pk_test_` / `sk_test_`) if:
- ✅ You're still testing the site
- ✅ You want to test without charging real money
- ✅ You're in development mode
- ✅ You want to verify everything works first

### Use Live Keys (`pk_live_` / `sk_live_`) if:
- ✅ Your site is live and ready for customers
- ✅ You want to accept real payments
- ✅ You've tested everything with test keys
- ✅ You're ready to go live

## How to Get Live Keys

1. **Go to**: https://dashboard.stripe.com
2. **Click**: "Developers" → "API keys"
3. **Toggle**: Switch from "Test mode" to "Live mode" (top right)
4. **Copy** the live keys:
   - Publishable key (starts with `pk_live_`)
   - Secret key (starts with `sk_live_`)
5. **Update** in Vercel:
   - Replace `NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` with live publishable key
   - Replace `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` with live secret key
6. **Redeploy** without cache

## Important Notes

### ⚠️ Don't Mix Test and Live Keys
- **Don't use**: `pk_test_` with `sk_live_`
- **Don't use**: `pk_live_` with `sk_test_`
- **Always use**: Both test OR both live (matching pairs)

### ✅ Test Keys Work in Production
- Test keys (`pk_test_`) will work on your live site
- They just won't charge real money
- Perfect for testing before going live

### 🔒 Security
- **Publishable keys** (`pk_test_` / `pk_live_`) are safe to expose in frontend code
- **Secret keys** (`sk_test_` / `sk_live_`) must NEVER be exposed - only in Vercel environment variables

## Current Status

If you have `pk_test_` keys:
- ✅ **This is correct** for testing
- ✅ Your site will work
- ✅ You can test payments with test cards
- ⚠️ **Won't charge real money** (which is good for testing!)

## When to Switch to Live Keys

Switch to live keys (`pk_live_`) when:
1. ✅ You've tested everything with test keys
2. ✅ You're ready to accept real payments
3. ✅ Your site is fully functional
4. ✅ You want customers to pay with real cards

## Quick Checklist

- [ ] Test keys (`pk_test_` / `sk_test_`) = For testing ✅
- [ ] Live keys (`pk_live_` / `sk_live_`) = For real payments ✅
- [ ] Both keys must match (both test OR both live)
- [ ] Test keys work fine on your live site (just won't charge real money)

## Summary

**Your `pk_test_` key is CORRECT!** 

It's a test key, which is perfect for:
- Testing your payment flow
- Making sure everything works
- Not charging real money during testing

When you're ready to accept real payments, switch to `pk_live_` keys. But for now, `pk_test_` is exactly what you need!
